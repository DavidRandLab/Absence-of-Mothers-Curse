Maternal inheritance allows selection to act on mtDNA-encoded effects in females but prevents direct selection on mtDNA in males. Mutations that are deleterious in males but neutral or beneficial in females can persist in populations. This predicts that mtDNA-based phenotypic variation should be more common among males than among females, a pattern referred to as Mother’s Curse (MC). Most studies of MC place alternative mtDNAs on common homozygous nuclear chromosomal backgrounds, a condition not common in nature. Moreover, it is not known whether MC effects accumulate as mtDNAs acquire nucleotide substitutions between populations or species. We tested the MC hypothesis using mtDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster (OreR, Zimbabwe or w1118), D. simulans (siI and siII) and D. yakuba each placed on a several D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds heterozygous for different chromosomal deficiencies paired with a common w1118,chromosome set. Females and males were tested for starvation, climbing speed and flight performance. In the majority of chromosomal backgrounds the variance among mtDNA genotypes was greater in females than in males, opposite from the central prediction of Mother’s Curse. This suggests that additive and dominance variation across the nuclear genome may provide nuclear blessings that can counter the curse of maternally inherited mtDNA.
